<h1> Hello world! </h1>
<body>
<p> My name is Mikayla. I am a fourth year Critical Race and Ethnic Studies major with a minor in Film and Digital Media. I am super new to programming and this course has become a challenge for me but I'm looking forward to learning more about programming and coding in this class. My name is Jaq. I am a fourth-ish year, Theatre major. I am also a code novice, but I have ideas and want to use my creativity to really get the most out of this course. </p>
