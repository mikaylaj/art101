				 <h3> Challenges<h3/>
					 <p> Some of our challenges included the "inspect" portion
					 of the lab on google chrome and the script output section. As well as making
				 the source output appear. </P>
				<h4> Problems </h4>
				<p> We couldn't seem to match the inspect to the image on the lab.<p/>
				<h5>Results</h5>
				<p> We were really happy with our results!</p>

	<h6> Debugging</h6>
  <p> *Update* We had a really a hard time getting the css to transfer. We went look through our work and realized that link to our css was not in our index/html
		that is why it was not showing in our work. </p>
